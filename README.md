# Max Aeon Parks

I'm a researcher and educator specializing in the Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human Factors within AI systems, particularly from a computer science perspective. My work investigates how AI can be ethically developed and integrated into human environments, focusing on bias mitigation, emotional intelligence benchmarks, and the extended cognition hypothesis.

## Research Interests

* **Philosophy of AI**: Ethical implications of AI systems, theories of AI consciousness, and the philosophical foundations of AI-driven decision-making.
* **Human Factors in AI**: Interdisciplinary research on human-AI interaction, emotional intelligence in AI, and usability of AI systems from a cognitive science and computer science standpoint.

## Educational Projects

* **Duck-Rabbit Î¦ Game**: An interactive philosophy game designed for children that introduces fundamental philosophical concepts through engaging storytelling and interactive gameplay. This game aims to foster critical thinking and philosophical inquiry among young audiences. \[Playable version coming soon to my website!]

## Teaching

I regularly teach courses in Philosophy, Ethics, and STEM-related subjects at the college level. My approach emphasizes critical thinking, applied ethics, and the thoughtful integration of AI into education.

## Artwork

Alongside my academic work, I am an artist focusing on existential aesthetics and AI-generated art. My artistic projects explore the intersections between technology, identity, and the human condition, serving as an expressive complement to my academic research.
