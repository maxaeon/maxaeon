I am a front-end web developer leveraging an extensive philosophy and psychology background to build a more intuitive user experience on the web. Iâ€™m currently working toward a certificate in full stack development from Michigan State University with newly developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. Iâ€™m known as an innovative problem solver passionate about web development, with a focus on accessibility.

With each project, my aim is to best engage my audience for an impactful user experience. For example, I recently worked on a team of four to develop a single-page COVID-19 informational app that helps individuals in the COVID-19 pandemic access reliable information about national, continental, and state data. Iâ€™m looking forward to using my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better experiences on the web.
